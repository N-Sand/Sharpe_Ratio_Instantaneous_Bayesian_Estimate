I use Bayesian hierarchical models and stochastic differential equations via PyMC to give an instantaneous estimate of the "Sharpe ratio" of a financial asset. 
We assume the asset value to be Brownian motion with non-constant SRW estimates of drift and volatility to construct a realistic estimate of Sharpe ratio over time.
